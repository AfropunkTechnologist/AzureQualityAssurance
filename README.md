# Azure Quality Assurance

### Overview

Built a systemic application monitoring process based on alert triggers in Azure Monitor and custom log 
files in Azure Log Analytics to determine where failures may have occurred ensuring optimal app performance 
and functionality.

Used cloud DevOps tools in MS Azure and Terraform to create disposable test environments within a CI/CD 
pipelines to run a variety of automated tests with the push of a button. 

Deployed my cloud application to a test environment that automatically executes load, integration, and 
functional tests.
